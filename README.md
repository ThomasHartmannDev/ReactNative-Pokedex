## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn (as package managers)
- Expo CLI

You can install Expo CLI globally by running:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
or
```bash
yarn global add expo-cli
```

## Installation

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/ThomasHartmannDev/ReactNative-Pokedex>
```


### Step 2: Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

Using npm:
```bash
cd ReactNative-Pokedex
npm install
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
cd ReactNative-Pokedex
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Start the development server

Launch the development server with Expo:

Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Expo developer tools. You can now run the app on your device by scanning the QR code with the Expo Go app or run it in an iOS or Android simulator.

## Running the app on a simulator or device

To run the app on an iOS simulator, ensure you have Xcode installed, then use:
```bash
npm run ios
```
or
```bash
yarn ios
```

To run the app on an Android emulator, ensure you have Android Studio setup, then use:
```bash
npm run android
```
or
```bash
yarn android
```

## Additional Commands

To build the app for production, use:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate a production build of your app, which you can deploy to a service of your choice.
